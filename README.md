# Work Day Scheduler

This is a daily planner to organize your day.

## Simple Calendar App

Presented here is a 10 hour standard day planner. It is broken down into 10 hours of the work day for you to input your plans. When you come to this page, you will see the day followed by the hourly breakdown.

This webpage was built to sort out my hourly plans during the day. I can set my plans for each hour and it stores to remind me what I need to do. That is an amazing feature, you can refresh the page and it will show you your hourly plans!

## Usage

This is a simple to you use webpage. Click on the link below to be taken to the page. Once there, enter your plans for each specified hour. Click the flag on the right side of the page to save your plans. You can leave the site and when you come back, your plans will still be there! Plans will only update when you enter something new.

Shown below is how I built each for row to operate by individually. I set variables my for classes and iD's. I used moment JS to keep track of my times. Pending on what time of day it is, the color box of your plans will change. Lastly you can see how I saved it to Local Storage.
